# Two-Stage-Fully-Differential-Amplifier(Technology Node used 130nm)
A two-stage fully differential amplifier is a type of operational amplifier (op amp) that consists of two stages: a differential amplifier and an inverting amplifier. The differential amplifier produces an amplified version of the difference in input signals, while the inverting amplifier provides a large voltage gain
